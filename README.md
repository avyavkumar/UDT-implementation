###### A lightweight UDT protocol written in C/C++.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
UDT is a data transport protocol written on top of UDP, and implements its own methodologies to emulate a faster version of TCP over a WAN. The original UDT was developed by Yunhong Gu during his PhD studies at the National Center for Data Mining (NCDM) of University of Illinois at Chicago in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Grossman. It is still maintained by him and the standard can be found on [Sourceforge] (http://udt.sourceforge.net/). A draft has been prepared by Yunhong Gu and can be found [here] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gg-udt-03).

This repository contains a simplified version of the same. A complete list of features will follow, as well as differences from the existing UDT protocol.
